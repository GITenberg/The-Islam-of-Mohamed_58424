<p>I do not desire to explain the importance and significance of
Islam among the religious systems of the world; nor am I to
fix and ascertain the exact position of Mohamed as a religious teacher
among the world’s great teachers of religions. My effort in this
paper is simpler and yet not altogether free from bewildering perplexities.
I desire to explain what Islam is and what its teachings
are: Islam as preached and delivered by the prophet of Arabia;
Islam stripped of the accretions of ages of theological disputes and
controversies; in other words to sketch out, to the best of my
light and leading, Islam of the prophet Mohamed. Difficult though
this task is, it is not indeed a hopeless venture for one who has
kept himself clear and free from narrow sectarianism.</p>

<p>To fully appreciate the message of Mohamed, it is essential
that I should say something about the condition of Arabia before
Islam. I must readily admit that so far as the Pagan Arabia is
concerned, we are in great dearth of authorities. Our information
is shadowy, fitful, and fragmentary and the industry of
European scholars (such as Caussin De Perceval, Krehl, Wellhausen,
Robertson Smith and Sir Charles Lyall) has succeeded but in
lifting the veil merely at its fringe. But however partial and
unsatisfactory as the account is, of the Pagan days; we can yet form
an idea of the life that the Pagan Arabs led and the thoughts that
swayed and animated their conduct and their deeds. I will, therefore,
describe “The Pre-Islamic Arabia” as briefly as I can.</p>

<p>The Pre-Islamic Arabs were not a nation. Of the sense of nationality,
indeed, they had not the vaguest conception, though they
were linked by community of speech. Arabia was a sum-total of
loose and disconnected congeries of tribes and the tribe was the
source and the limit of social and political obligation. Beyond the
tribe there lay no duty and no obligation either. Political relations
were moral; for morality was confined within the limits of the
tribe. Political organisation was represented by the corporate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
feeling which found expression in the exercise of the duties of
brotherhood. Within the pale of the tribe obtained the prohibition
to kill, to commit adultery, to steal, &amp;c., &amp;c. Beyond it there
was no such prohibition. Fidelity to one’s kinsman was an
imperative duty, apart from any question of the justness of the
cause.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Outside the tribe there was nothing but constant plunder
and unceasing warfare. “Certain large groups were, indeed,
almost continually at war with one another. Ma`add, the people
of the Hijaz and Al-yamamah generally looked upon Al-yaman as
their natural prey and were constantly raiding on the herds of
their southern neighbours. Between Tamim and Bakr, son of
Wail, there was permanent bad blood, Ghatafan and Hawazin
had a standing feud. In the north the kingdom of Al-Hirah, the
representative of Persian predominance was the hereditary enemy
of Ghassan, the representative of the might of Rome.” (Lyall,
<i>Ancient Arabian Poetry</i>, p. xxiii.) Arabia, before Islam, was thus
a theatre of internecine warfare, restrained, but partially, by the
introduction of blood money. There was compensation for
everything for which vengeance could be exacted. All crimes
were assessed as economic damage. Every loss of honor, property,
or life could be appraised by agreement; all having their
price in camels. We thus see that the Arabs before Islam had
scarcely emerged from barbaric conditions.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There was no
social order, no organised government. The law of sheer
brute force prevailed, untempered and unrestrained, by any
civilizing or controlling influence. Nor did they attain any
refined idea of religion. Their religion was nothing more or
less than gross fetichism; the worship of tree and stone, the
veneration of certain personified divine attributes, meaningless
ritual and ceremonials. The true religious spirit they never
succeeded in grasping and the fear of God never exercised
any real, practical influence over their conduct and actions.
It was reserved for Islam to instil into them the sense
of responsibility to God and to make this idea of human responsibility
the guiding and controlling principle of life. To all
appearance the Arabs honoured the gods, went on pilgrimage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>
their sanctuaries, made sacrifices in the temples, anointed with
the blood of the victims gods carved out of stone or made of wood,
consulted the oracles, when in difficulty, and questioned them
about the future. But all this was sham and counterfeit. Of
real, genuine, religious feeling there was none. This empty show,
however, was kept up for purposes of gain; the manifold sanctuaries
yielding large incomes to certain noble families and clans.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In a soil, apparently so uncongenial, how did Islam
strike its root? This is an interesting and fascinating
question and we must try to solve it here. The solution of this
question is to be found in the existence of Judaism and
Christianity, on the one hand, and in the commercial activity of
the Arabs, on the other. By commerce the Arabs acquired an
extended knowledge of foreign nations and their civilisation.
Frequent contact with the outer world widened their intellectual
horizon and awakened in them higher and more spiritual
thoughts. They learnt new ideas, acquired new habits and, what
was most valuable of all, they learnt to think for themselves.
But not merely did travel in foreign countries and intercourse
with foreign people exercise a disruptive influence, but there
were forces, alike subversive and destructive, nearer home. In
Arabia itself the two streams of Christianity and Judaism flowed,
side by side, with the Arab Heathenism.</p>

<p>That Christianity had made a considerable advance among
the Arabs is clear from the fact, that, at the time of Mohamed, it
was considerably diffused not merely among the Rabia tribes but
even among the Tamim. Nor did the Taiyy altogether escape
its influence. Its growth, however, was not so favourable in
Hijaz and central Arabia, but even here Christian ideas undoubtedly
made their way through commerce and social intercourse.
Similarly the Jewish influence was equally powerful. When the
Jews came to Arabia we do not definitely know, but Dr. Nöldeke
points out that a great Jewish immigration into Arabia cannot
be fixed prior to the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus and
Hadrian. At all events, it is clear that at the time of Mohamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span>
there was a large colony of Jews at Taima, Khaibar, Yathrib,
Fedak and Yaman. They did not live scattered amidst Arab
population but kept together and, though despised by the Ara`sq
they were yet indispensible to them as merchants, jewellers, and
goldsmiths. It would, therefore, be not an error to suppose that
they exerted no small spiritual influence over the Arabs.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> That
this is no unfounded theory or improbable supposition is evidenced
by the fact that in the works of four of the most prominent Arabian
poets of the Pre-Islamic time&mdash;An-Nabigah, Zuhair, Al-Asha and
Labid&mdash;we find expressions which show that they, at least, if not
the wild wanderers of the desert, knew very well what a spiritual
religion meant.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Ibn Qutaibah enumerates drinking, joy, wrath
and love among the “motive causes” which speed the poet but
we cannot fail to detect in their poems an undercurrent of deep
religious feelings. Individual minds felt a sense of uneasiness and
sought to find some plausible solution of the mysteries of life and
death and traces of such a frame of mind we notice frequently in
ancient Arab poetry. On no other basis, indeed, can we explain
away the lamentations of the royal poet Imra-ul-Qais over the
worthlessness of the life of pleasure that he had led and the conversion
to Christianity of Qais B. Zuhair, the leader of the Abs in the
long fratricidal war against the Dhubian.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In considering the rise
of Islam we cannot be unwatchful of the course of contemporary
thought or unmindful of the religious forces which contributed to
its success. Such, indeed, were the forces at work in Arabia before
Mohamed; forces which could not have failed to stir higher
thoughts in enlightened minds and to create a reaction against the
Arab Heathenism. And a reaction, indeed, did set in. A band
of distinguished men, whom we must recognise as the heralds and
standard-bearers of Islam, no longer willing to tolerate <span class="correction" title="In the original book: idolatorous">idolatrous</span>
practices, definitely cut themselves adrift from the Arabian
Paganism. They called themselves Hanifs; a word of doubtful
meaning and the cause of much controversy. “The most acceptable
conjecture seems to me”, says Sir Charles Lyall, “to be that
of Sprenger that it is connected with the Hebrew HANEF heretic.”
Hanifism had certain specific features: rejection of idolatory,
abstention from certain kinds of food, and the worship of “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span>
God of Abraham.” Ascetic practices, such as the wearing of
sackcloth, are also ascribed to some of the Hanifs.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Islamic
tradition has handed down to us the names of a number of religious
thinkers before Mohamed, who are described as Hanifs and of
whom the following is a list:&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li>Warakah b. Naufal of Kuraish.</li>
<li>Ubaidulla b. Jahsh.</li>
<li>Uthman b. Al Huwarith.</li>
<li>Zaid b. ´Amr b. Naufal.<br /><br />
<span class="out-list">Ibn Kutaibah adds to the above:&mdash;</span></li>
<li class="pad-top">Urbab b. al Bara´ of Abdul Qais</li>
<li>Umayyah b. Abi-s-Salt.</li>
<li>Kuss b. Saidah of Iyad (Aghani XIV, 41-44) Mohamed heard him at Ukaidh but he
died before the mission.</li>
<li>Abu Kais Simrah b. Abi Anas.</li>
<li>Khalid b. Sinan b. Ghaith of Abs.<br /><br />
<span class="out-list">To these Sir Charles Lyall adds:&mdash;</span></li>
<li class="pad-top">Abu Kais Saifi, Ibn Al-Aslat of the Aus-allah of Yathrib.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is impossible to misconceive the importance and significance
of Hanifism in the origin of Islam. The path was
already prepared for it and Islam offered to the Arabs what they
were long in search for: a moral, ethical, and spiritual teaching;
a higher form of worship and last but not least fraternity and union.
The tribal cults were henceforward merged in a higher worship
and the nobler energies of the Arab race obtained a religious
consecration.</p>

<p>Islam became the starting point for the Arabs for conquests,
alike spiritual and temporal. With Islam became the prerogative
of the Arab race to be “an ensign to the nations;” to bear
and to carry the banner of the true God to the remotest corner
of the earth. Hence the unceasing campaigns and hence the
far-extending conquests.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II.</h2>


<p>It is clear beyond doubt that Christian and Jewish influences,
to a large extent, unsettled and disturbed the beliefs of the
Pagan Arabs and paved the way for the prophet. Resistance
to his faith there was, but it was resistance on the part of those,
who sought to maintain the old faith and superstition; not on
account of any warmth of conviction or <span class="correction" title="In the original book: sincerety">sincerity</span> of zeal, but on
account of the fear and apprehension that the success of Islam
would mean loss of large incomes derived from the temples and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
old heathen practices.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But resistance, founded upon such a
selfish basis, could not prevent, and indeed did not prevent, the
onward progress of Islam. In the deadly conflict between Islam
and the Arab Heathenism Islam triumphed.</p>

<p>We, now, proceed to enquire as to what was the basis or, in
other words, what were the sources from which Islam was derived.
Islam freely borrowed from Judaism and Christianity and even did
not hesitate to adopt practices prevalent in Pre-Islamic Arabia.
In fashioning his religion the prophet adopted an eclectic method,
retaining or rejecting from the older systems whatever seemed
to him necessary and proper. It is not exactly within the scope
of my paper to precisely specify or to accurately define the
exact obligation of Islam to Christianity or Judaism. Such a
discussion would take me far afield. Professor Wellhausen is
inclined to belittle the influence of Judaism in the birth
and infancy of Islam and points to the Islamic conception
of Jesus, as the greatest of the prophets before Mohamed,
as a conclusive proof of his contention. But the present
writer is not prepared to attach much weight to this argument.
If the Islamic conception of Jesus, indeed, is to be put forward
as indicating the absence of Judaic influence on early Islam;
with equal force might the Islamic conception of Jesus be urged as
subversive of the theory of Christian influence, so stoutly advocated
by Professor Wellhausen.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The basis of dogmatic Christianity,
namely, the sonship of Christ, Mohamed inveighed against early
and late. It would be idle to deny the indebtedness of Islam to
Judaism. Mohamed has not merely accepted dogmas and doctrines
of Judaism, minute Talmudical ordinances, but has even adopted,
in its entirety, some of the Jewish practices and, far above all
these, that which indeed constitutes the very foundation of
Islam, namely, the conception of a severe and uncompromising
monotheism.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The fact is that both Judaism and Christianity
were used and used freely by the prophet in building up his
religion. Nor is this a new theory. The prophet never put him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>self
forward as introducing something new but he invariably claimed
for himself the honour of reviving the old and the true beliefs
which had fallen into neglect and oblivion. But besides the
Jewish and Christian sources, not a small portion of Islamic ritual
and ceremonials were mere reproductions of Pre-Islamic practices.
The entire ceremonies relating to the pilgrimage (Hajj) and the
sacred service, at the temple of Mecca, have survived in Islam
with little or no variation from the days of Arab Heathenism;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
the only change that Mohamed effected in them was to allow the
pilgrims to put on a particular pilgrim dress consisting of two
pieces of cloth of which one covers the hip and the other breast
and shoulders; while the head has to be kept uncovered, as in
ancient days, when they used to make up their hair into a sort of
wig by means of some glutinous substance. And so indeed it has
remained, to this day, the prescribed pilgrim costume. After
visiting the Kabah they used, in heathen days, to visit the two
rocky hills of Safa and Merwah on which were placed two bronze
idols. Mohamed went so far in his toleration of the heathen
pilgrimage customs that he suffered the visit to Safa and Marwah
to continue as before, but had the two idols removed. Of the
history of the origin of the forms of the prayer, prostration,
ablution, and fasts our knowledge is vague, uncertain and
shadowy.</p>

<p>Islam has, says Von Kremer,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>largely drawn upon Judaism, Christianity, the religion of Zoroaster and
possibly even from Manichenism. From Parsiism it has taken both directly and
indirectly. A number of obviously Parsi ideas have penetrated into Islam through
the channel of Jewish books; notably the Talmud. The doctrine of the resurrection,
most of the legends relating to heaven and hell, and the entire system of
demonology have found their way into the Qur´an through Judaism. So indeed
did the description of the trial and the tortures of the dead in the grave by two angels
<i>Munkar</i> and <i>Nakir</i>. The idea of the bridge <i>sirat</i> as thin as a hair, which leads
to paradise across the abyss of hell is certainly derived from the Parsis; having
passed over into the Qur´an through the Midrash. But Islam has not hesitated to
borrow directly from Parsiism. It is a significant fact that the word <i>din</i>, which so
repeatedly occurs in the Qur´an, has been borrowed from the Parsi books. In the
Huzveresh it appears in exactly the same form (old Backtrian dæna).<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor"><span class="correction" title="Footnote anchor redirected to new footnote by transcriber.">[12]</span></a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span></p>
<p>It is not suggested that the prophet had access to the written
books of either the Jews or the Christians; though in some passages
of the Qur´an we can trace direct resemblances to the text of
the Old Testament and the Mishna.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> His knowledge of the Jewish
and Christian books, at times faulty and imperfect to a degree, was
derived almost exclusively by oral communications.</p>

<p>I trust I have said enough to illustrate the condition of Arabia
before Islam and the sources from which the prophet of Arabia
received his religious inspiration. I, now, go on to explain Islam
and its tenets.</p>

<p>Mr. Ameer Ali explains Islam as “striving after righteousness,”
but Prof. Hirschfeld, in his luminous <i>Researches into the
Composition and Exegesis of the Qur´an</i>, very correctly points out
that Mr. Ameer Ali’s definition only reflects the theoretical and
moral side of the question&mdash;limited to the initial stage of Islam.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The term Islam, as time went by, included the whole of the
theoretical and practical constitution of the faith and as such it
is interpreted by Al-Ghazzali in his Ihya-ul-ulum (p. 104, vol. I.)
Islam, says he, is an expression for submission and unquestioning
obedience, abandonment of insubordination, defiance and opposition.
And it is in this light, indeed, that the prophet himself regarded
Islam. <span class="correction" title="Quotation and citation restructured by transcriber. See Transcriber's Note at end of document for details.">“The Bedwins say: ‘we believe,’ Speak! you
shall not ‘believe’ (only) but say we practice Islam (Aslamna).” (XLIX. 14)</span> In
Surah III. 17 (Cf. V. 79) Islam is identified with <i>din</i> (Cf. LXI.
7-9) and the relation between the two synonyms, says Prof.
Hirschfeld, is broadly discussed by Al-Shahrastani (Milal, pp. 25 to
27) and is stated to embrace the five duties, <i>viz.</i>:&mdash;Of testifying
to the unity of God and the Divine inspiration of Mohamed, the
duties of reciting prayers, giving alms, fasting in the <i>Ramadhan</i>,
and performing the pilgrimage to Mecca. The fundamental
basis of Islam is the unity of God; stern, unbending monotheism
and this doctrine of the unity of God is proclaimed in the Qur´an,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
in season and out of season and ever and anon with augmented
emphasis. To associate gods with God is the most unpardonable
sin and the prophet’s extensive vocabulary of vituperation is never
exhausted in attacking those who associate gods with God. In
Surah VI (verses 74-79) we have one of the most charming passages
testifying to the unity of God:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And remember when Abraham said to his father, Azar, thou takest those
images as God? verily I see that thou and thy people are in manifest error.</p>

<p>And so did we show Abraham the domain of the heavens and of the earth that he
might be one of those who are established in knowledge. And when the night overshadowed
him he beheld a star “This, said he, is My Lord” but when it set, he
cried, “I love not gods which set.” And when he beheld the moon uprising “This,”
said he, “is my Lord” but when it set, he said, “surely, if My Lord guide me not I
shall be of those who go astray.”</p>

<p>And when he beheld the Sun uprise, he said, “This is my Lord,” “this is the
greatest” but when it set, he said “O my people I share not with you the guilt of
joining gods with God.”</p>

<p><i>I verily turn my face to him who hath created the Heavens and the earth following
the right religion and I am not one of those who add gods to God.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Not a whit has Gibbon<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> exaggerated the truth when he
wrote “the creed of Mohamed is free from suspicion or ambiguity
and the Qur´an is a glorious testimony to the unity of God. The
prophet of Mecca rejected the worship of idols and men, of stars
and planets, on the rational principle that whatever is born must
die, that whatever is corruptible must decay and perish.” And,
again, says the historian of the Roman Empire, “these sublime
truths, thus announced in the language of the prophet, are firmly
held by his disciples and defined with metaphysical precision by
the interpreters of the Qur´an. A philosophic atheist might
subscribe the popular creed of Mohamedans: a creed too sublime
perhaps for our present faculties.”</p>

<p>The unity of God, therefore, is the central faith of Islam
and connected with it, by natural process as it were, is the
belief that man is responsible to the creator for his actions and
deeds. This belief, the Pre-Islamic Arab never knew or conceived,
and the prophet Mohamed, by inculcating this belief, not only
laid the foundation of a spiritual life among his countrymen, but
laid the foundation of a well-organized society; soon destined
to grow into a magnificent empire. The sphere of duty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
obligation, charity and sympathy, confined hitherto merely to
tribesmen, was widened and extended and the narrow tribal tie was
lost in the larger brotherhood of faith. At this distance of time, it
is perhaps difficult for us to fully realize the influence of this teaching,
but to it alone must we ascribe the dethronement of those
ideals of Arabian Paganism which the author of the <i>Muhammedanische
Studien</i> has so graphically described, comparing and contrasting
them with the higher ideals substituted by Islam.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The
religion of the prophet, like the wand of a magician, completely
and utterly changed the life of the Arabs. It hushed their
tribal disputes into silence, it destroyed their insularity, it set up
a purer and a more refined standard of domestic life, it opened
before them fresh vistas of spiritual happiness and temporal
success.</p>

<p>Next to the unity of God, Islam enjoins five daily prayers
upon its followers. It is curious that the Qur´an lays down no rule
as to the manner in which the prayer should be offered. Apparently,
as Mr. Ameer Ali<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> points out, the practice of the prophet
has associated certain rights and ceremonies to the due observance
of prayers. In the Mohamedan prayer we observe the Jewish
practice of standing erect, the Christian of prostration and a
third of inclination.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Orginally">Originally</span> the prophet instituted three daily
prayers.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Their extension to five was an innovation of the late
Meccan period; the details of the purity legislation appear to have
still later. “Yet the theory,” says Prof. Margoliouth, “that
God should be approached only by persons in a state of purity
was known in South Arabia before Mohamed’s time, whence it is
probable that his earliest converts were instructed therein.”</p>

<p>Prayers are to be performed five times in course of every day:
between daybreak and sunrise, between noon and the “asr” (which
later period is about mid-time between noon and nightfall) between
the ‘asr’ and sunset, between sunset and the “asha” (or the
period when the darkness of night commences) and at, or after
the “asha.” It is considered more meritorious to take part in the
public <i>salat</i> of the community conducted by a leader (Imam) than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
to discharge the <i>salat</i> by oneself.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor"><span class="correction" title="Footnote anchor missing, placed by transcriber.">[20]</span></a> Von Kremer has rightly emphasised
the importance of the Muslim prayer by recognizing the mosque
as the drill ground for the warlike believers of early Islam. In stern
discipline, in unconditional obedience, says Von Kremer, the author
of the <i><span class="correction" title="In the original book: Culturgeschichite">Culturgeschichte</span> des orients</i>, lay the greatest achievement of
Mohamed and the real secret of the strength of Islam.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor"><span class="correction" title="Footnoe anchor partially obscured in original text, corrected by transcriber.">[21]</span></a> The five
daily prayers where the leader (the Imam) stood before the community,
closely arrayed behind him, and where every movement of
his was imitated with military preciseness, by the hundreds of the
faithful assembled in the mosque, served, among the Muslims, in
those times, the purpose of that what is known now as the drill
ground: a school where the people learnt to assemble, to move in
a body and to follow the Commander.</p>

<p>In the Qur´an<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> the command to pay the poor-tax (zakat)
directly follows the command to pray: perform the prayers and pay
the poor-tax. This tax had a strong communistic complexion
which is evidenced by the following tradition: “The prophet sent
Ma´dh to Yaman and told him: summon them to accept the
confession of faith namely, there is no God but Allah and I that am
his prophet; if they listen to it; teach them further that God has
ordained five daily prayers; if they are also agreeable to this;
teach them further that God has enjoined the poor-tax (sadakah)
payable by the wealthy upon their property for distribution among
the poor.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This tax was annually payable upon camels, oxen
(bulls and cows) and buffalos, sheep and goats, horses and mules
and asses and gold and silver (whether in money or ornaments,
etc.,) provided the property was of a certain amount; as five
camels, thirty oxen, forty sheep, five horses, two hundred dirhams,
or twenty dinars.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The proportion is generally one-fortieth, which
is to be paid in kind or in money or other equivalent.</p>

<p>The third most important obligation enjoined by Islam is
fasting in the month of <i>Ramadhan</i>. The Muslim must abstain
from eating and drinking and from every indulgence of the senses,
every day during the month of <i>Ramadhan</i>, from the first appearance
of daybreak until sunset, unless physically incapacitated. The last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
but not least is the pilgrimage to Mecca and mount Arafat, which
the Muslim must perform at least once in his life.</p>

<p>These then; namely, the unity of God, the belief in the Divine
mission of the prophet, five daily prayers, fasting in the month of
<i>Ramadhan</i> and the pilgrimage, are the essentials of Islam. The
one supreme mission of the prophet was to create and to maintain
an absolute brotherhood in faith. All Muslims were declared
equal, irrespective of birth, rank or profession; and the world has
never seen, perhaps, a more perfect democracy than the one called
into being by the prophet. Truly, the most worthy of honour
in the sight of God, says the Qur´an, is he who feareth Him most;
for the faithful are brethren; whereupon make peace between your
brethren. A similar refrain runs through the parting sermon of
the prophet; “O men! God has taken away from you the arrogance
and pride of ancestry of heathen days. An Arab has no excellence
or superiority over a barbarian than that which is secured to him
by his God-fearing and righteousness. Ye are all the progeny
of Adam, and Adam himself is of the Earth.”</p>

<p>No caste and no priestcraft does Islam recognise. Every
Muslim is his own priest and every spot of land is his <i>mosque</i> to
pray and to worship <i>Allah</i>. For no other purpose than to keep
alive the sense of corporate unity of the Muslims did the prophet
declare the superiority of the public prayer over prayer by oneself
and establish the institution of pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Year after year, from all parts of the Islamic world, streamed
to Mekka, Muslims in thousands and tens of thousands, to
worship Allah at the Ka´bah and to perform the <i>Hajj</i>. There,
at Mekka, year after year, Muslims of divers nationalities
recognised and realised the potent spell of their faith and
felt more deeply and keenly than ever the tie which bound them
together. Moreover, as Von Kremer points out, there did the
Muslims obtain an opportunity of listening to the lectures of
far-famed professors and men of letters who attracted, year by
year, an ever-increasing audience. There indeed, did Islam
shine forth in its full lustre; attracting and alluring, enthralling
and captivating its followers, as it could do nowhere else. Every
spot, associated with some historical incident; every place,
connected with some important event or other of the life of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
teacher, awakened the love and fired the enthusiasm of Muslims
for the son of Abdullah, the maker of Arabia and the
founder of Islam.</p>

<p>In his fascinating book, <i>The Life and Teachings of Mohamed</i>,
Mr. Ameer Ali has admirably summed up the Islamic teachings:&mdash;“Nothing
can be simpler or more in accord with the advance of
the human intellect than the teachings of the Arabian prophet.
The few rules for religious ceremonial which he prescribed
were chiefly with the object of maintaining discipline and uniformity,
so necessary in certain stages of society, but they were
by no means of an inflexible character. He allowed them to be
broken in cases of illness or other causes. ‘God wishes to make
things easy for you, for’ says the Qur´an ‘man was created weak.’
The legal principles which he enunciated were either delivered
as answers to questions put to him as the Chief Magistrate of
Medina or to remove or correct patent evils. The prophet’s
Islam recognized no ritual likely to distract the mind from the
thought of the one God, no law to keep enchained the conscience
of advancing humanity.”</p>

<p>Nothing was more distant from the prophet’s thought
than to fetter the mind or to lay down fixed, immutable,
unchanging laws for his followers. The Qur´an is a book of
guidance to the faithful and not, to be sure, an obstacle
in the path of their social, moral, legal and intellectual progress.
The requirements of Islam are at once easy and simple and
leave scope to Muslims to take part in their duties as subjects
or citizens; to attend to their religious obligations without
sacrificing their worldly prosperity and to adopt, whatever is
good, in any community or civilisation, without any interference
on the part of their religion.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV.</h2>


<p>I shall now make a few general observations on the religion
of the prophet of Arabia. Whatever Islam may have become
through pharisaic artificiality and theological subtlety, its
leading principles are as broad as the starriest heavens and as
enduring as the everlasting hills. It contains, in common
with other great religions, those eternal truths which are
only too liable to be forgotten in blind zeal, in warmth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
controversy, in sectarian narrow-mindedness, in religious fanaticism
but which our education and culture teach us to discover and
appreciate, wherever we find them. The governing principle
of all religions is the same. In the language of the apostle
James: “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the
Father is this; to visit the fatherless and widows in their
affliction and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.” This
is the burden of all religions and this the burden of Islam.</p>

<p>The kernel and doctrine of Islam, Goethe has found in the
second <i>surah</i> which begins as follows:&mdash;“This is the Book. There
is no doubt in the same. A guidance to the righteous, who
believe in the unseen, who observe the prayer and who give alms
of that which we have vouchsafed unto them. And who believe
in that which has been sent down unto thee&mdash;(the Revelation)
which had been sent down to those before thee, and who believe
in the life to come. They walk in the guidance of their Lord,
and they are the blessed. As to them who believe not&mdash;it is
indifferent to them whether thou exhortest them or not exhortest
them. They will not believe. Sealed hath Allah their
hearts and their ears and over their eye is darkness and theirs
will be a great punishment.&mdash;” “And in this wise,” Goethe
continues, “we have <i>surah</i> after <i>surah</i>. Belief and unbelief
are divided into higher and lower. Heaven and hell await
the believers or deniers. Detailed inductions of things allowed
and forbidden, legendary stories of Jewish and Christian religion,
amplifications of all kinds, boundless tautologies and repetitions,
form the body of this sacred volume, which, to us, as often as
we approach it, is repellent anew, next attracts us ever anew
and fills us with admiration, and finally forces us into veneration.”</p>

<p>This passage, indeed, is as good a summary as any other, but
there is one, and in this same chapter, still more explicit, illustrating
the catholicity of the prophet’s mind and his discerning
judgment. When Mohamed, says Deutsch<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, told his adherents
at Medina no longer to turn in prayer towards Jerusalem but
towards the Ka´bah at Mekka, to which their fathers had turned,
and he was blamed for this innovation he replied:&mdash;“That is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>
righteousness: whether ye turn your faces towards east or
west, God’s is the east as well as the west. But verily righteousness
is his who believes in God, in the day of judgment,
in the angels, in the book and the prophets; who bestows his
wealth for God’s sake, upon kindred, and orphans, and the
poor, and the homeless, and all those who ask; and also upon
delivering the captives; he who is steadfast in prayer, giveth
alms, who stands firmly by his covenants, when he has once
entered into them; and who is patient in adversity, in hardship
and in times of trial. These are the righteous, and these are
the God-fearing.” What a noble idea of life and religion do
we find here. It is not merely the recitation of prayers which
constitutes righteousness but in solemnly acting the religion
we profess; in tender regard for the poor and the orphan,
the forlorn and the suffering; in relieving the miseries of the
captives, in holding by the promises made, in enduring with
calm fortitude the trials and reverses of fortune. Here, in this
passage, we have the key to Islam, nay, I would go further and
say a key to all religions. It is only the clouded vision which
sees difference between one religion and the other; to one who
has the eyes to see and the heart to feel, all religions appear
as but a reflection of one and the same light.</p>

<p>This was the spirit of the prophet’s religion which he
preached in the Qur´an in every accent of pleading and warning,
of pathos and hope, of repentance and forgiveness. He stood
firm by his faith unshaken by threats and persuasion. His
success, indeed, marks the ascent of the soul, of the higher
and nobler nature of man from the darkness to the light. Nor
was it a different light to that which had appeared to humanity
“at sundry times and in divers manners.” His preaching fell on
the Arabs, still in the spring tide of their national life, and
laid a tremendous hold upon their mind and their imagination;
changing and transforming them and giving them as it were,
a new existence. It taught them firmness of resolve, contempt
of death, singleness of purpose, unity and fraternity, and it gave
them that intensity of religious fervour which became the most
valued asset of their national life. Above all, says Dr. Nöldeke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
Islam gave and gives, to those who profess it a feeling of confidence
such as is imparted by hardly any other faith.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> And,
indeed, it was this, again, which made them great warriors and

<p>Islam possesses an inherent force and vitality which nothing
can weaken or <span class="correction" title="In the original book: destory">destroy</span>. It carries within it germs of progress
and development and has great powers of adaptability to changing
circumstances. There is nothing in its teachings which
conflicts with or militates against modern civilisation, and the
moment Muslims realise this truth their future will be assured
and their greatness only a question of time. Modern
Islam, with its hierarchy of priesthood, gross fanaticism, appalling
ignorance and superstitious practices, is, indeed, a discredit to
the Islam of the prophet Mohamed. Instead of unity we have
Islam torn into factions, instead of culture we have indifference
to learning; instead of liberal-minded toleration we have gross
bigotry. But this intellectual darkness must necessarily be
followed by intellectual dawn and we trust, that it is not
now far distant or too long to come.</p>

<p>An impartial consideration of the life of the prophet and
his teachings cannot fail to awaken the warmest admiration
for the man and his mission. Whatever may be the defects in the
Qur´an, even non-Muslims must concede that it is a noble testimony
to the unity of God and whatever may be the blemishes
in the life of the prophet, none, but a perverse mind, will regard
him as anything but sincere in his conviction, honest in his
purpose and unshaken in his resolve. Mohamedan civilisation
was the outcome of Mohamedan faith and nothing but Islam
alone can again give to the Mohamedans what they have lost:
their civilisation, their culture, and their empire.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Hindustan_Review" id="The_Hindustan_Review"></a>The Hindustan Review.</h2>

<p class="author">Edited by SACHCRIDANANDA SINHA, Barrister-at-Law.</p>


<p class="p2">IS A HIGH CLASS MONTHLY, PUBLISHED at Allahabad, and widely circulated
among all classes of the public, European and Indian.</p>

<p>The special features of the Review comprise: (1) Not less than <i>six</i> articles on
topics of the day or matters of permanent interest, written by most competent
and distinguished contributors; (2) Exhaustive reviews of important English and
Anglo-Indian publications, including important legal text-books written by those
who are experts in their line; (3) An editorial survey of the month embracing all
topics of interest and importance.</p>

<p>Why should you <i>advertise</i> in the <i>Hindustan Review</i>? Because it is widely
circulated, to advertise in it is the surest way of reaching people capable of doing
business with you.</p>

<p>Believe in facts. Here is what the <b>Administration Report of the Provincial
Government, for the year 1907-08</b> says:</p>

<p>“<b>Of the newspapers and periodicals in English,&mdash;the Hindustan
Review had the largest circulation.</b>” The <i>Hindustan Review</i> is, therefore,
the best medium for advertisement.</p>

<p>Why should you <i>read</i> the <i>Hindustan Review</i>? Because it gives first class reading
matter and is the only Magazine that pays for contributions and attracts the best
writers from every race and <span class="correction" title="In the original book: sections">section</span>. This is why we have got such appreciative
notices from the Press. Look at our Select Press Opinions&mdash;</p>

<p>The <b>Pioneer</b> (Anglo-Indian Daily, Allahabad).&mdash;We have more than once
congratulated the <i>Hindustan Review</i>&mdash;an ably conducted Monthly containing really
excellent articles&mdash;on the place it has taken in periodical journalism. It would be
well if there were more journals inspired by the spirit of the <i>Hindustan Review</i>.
It appears in the garb of a first-class Monthly and has much more the appearance
of coming from the neighbourhood of Fleet Street than from an Indian Press. It
is appreciated by English readers who desire to keep in touch with the views and
interests of the moderate section of the educated Indian community.</p>

<p>The <b>Madras Mail</b> (Anglo-Indian Daily).&mdash;The <i>Hindustan Review</i>, which contains
contributions on questions of general interest, is conducted on excellent lines.
Its contents are varied and interesting, it is well-edited, and it well serves the
interest of the educated public.</p>

<p>The <b>Calcutta Weekly Notes</b> (Calcutta Legal Weekly).&mdash;The <i>Hindustan
Review</i> contains excellent reviews of legal works and contributions of considerable
merit dealing with important subjects.</p>

In the original text, these lines of a ghazal by Saib Tabrizi (1592-1676) were
included in Farsi with no attribution. In a book intended for an English speaking
audience that generally does not read Farsi, it is better to include the translation.
The original Farsi text was lines one and three (two hemistiches per line) of his Ghazal 2135.
Due to line length considerations, I have split the hemistiches to separate lines in the

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
